# Product-recommendation

Problem Statement:

The sales team at a retail company wanted to create a product profile to
suggest products to customers. Sales team members turned to their data
science team to recommend products to customers with machine learning
applications (MLOps).
In a meeting with the management team of the retail company, it was
suggested that the machine learning model be trained and tested with a
variety of data sets as needed. As a result, business users should be able to
upload training data to MLOps and select features through the user interface
(UI). Users should also be able to upload and preview test data to test the
model. Explanations AI functionality should be implemented by MLOps to help
business users understand what the model outcomes mean. To simplify and
better understand model outcomes, business users requested visual data
analysis functionality.
